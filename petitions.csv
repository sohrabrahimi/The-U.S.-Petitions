Every year in the United States, an estimated 6 to 8 million lost, abandoned, or unwanted dogs and cats enter animal shelters and nearly half of these animals—many of them healthy, young, and adoptable—must be euthanized because there are too many animals and not enough good homes. 

This tragedy occurs because people don't spay and neuter their animals and because greedy breeders continue to churn out more puppies. Because all dogs and cats are precious and because no more animals need to be bred when so many others go without hope of being adopted, PETA is calling for a mandatory spay-and-neuter law until all dogs and cats in the United States have a home to call their own. 

Sign the petition calling for a mandatory spay-and-neuter law to help end the animal overpopulation crisis.

Due to the way electoral votes are allocated, candidates have a strong incentive to focus their campaigns on "swing" states with many voters, such as Florida, and neglect states such as Texas which do not swing.   Due to necessary rounding errors when allocating votes, members of a sparsely populated state effectively accrue more voting power than members of a well-populated state.  This increases the electoral power of members of certain states while reducing it for others on an ongoing basis.

“Greetings, 
There are more than 52,000 Amerasian children in The Philippines and Japan; these are children of American fathers. 

Despite being born to American fathers, these children can’t come to America and reunite with them, because of Public Law 97-359; Amerasians from these countries cannot take advantage of Public Law 97-359 or other existing provisions of law. 

These children have American blood, they should be American citizens. I urge you to pass legislation to grant US citizenship to America’s forgotten children from Japan and The Philippines.

This legislation would grant US citizenship to children born out of wedlock to American citizen fathers (mostly military men) with foreign women overseas.

Many of such cases can be prevented or cured through transition to a plant-based diet.  Such a transition would reduce health care costs by up to $1.7 trillion.  A shift in policy to encourage vegan agriculture can also reduce 51% of greenhouse gas emissions.  A switch to a vegan diet could reduce climate change mitigation costs by 80%. Furthermore,  it can secure food and water shortage by consuming less resources and waste less foods.

We therefore urge you to save lives, the economy, the environment, and ultimately our planet, by providing subsidies to farmers who transition to OPF.  Financial assistance will ensure farmers succeed in OPF and provide Americans with affordable, healthy foods.

Currently, NASA’s budget barely surpasses 0.5 percent of the Federal budget, and has seen a steady decline in the proportions of its funding, now reaching all-time lows.  The cultural mindset brought on by NASA has allowed us to reap the benefits of economic growth, creating an influx of people wanting to become scientists and engineers.
There is no question that the government has money to fund NASA: $850 billion was spent on the bank bailout, several hundred billion dollars more than the 53 year running budget of NASA.  If we want to invest in our future, we must fund NASA at higher levels.

Tomorrow is gone without NASA.  Please at least double NASA’s annual budget, and continue to support the most inspirational program in the country.

The state of Connecticut already has a so-called "assault weapons" ban, considered by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as one of the strictest in the entire nation, and it did absolutely nothing to prevent this unspeakable tragedy. This speaks volumes for how completely and utterly useless this type of legislation ultimately is in deterring and preventing violent crime.","2012-12-15 07:28:14",4946,8652,16348,25000,Reviewed
50cce7890aa04d6d76000008,"Award the Medal Of Freedom to Victoria Soto","On Dec 14, 2012, in Newtown, CT, a gunman had taken the life of 27 innocent people, 20 of whom were children. Victoria Soto, 27, had presented the spirit of a warrior by attempting to get all of her students into a closet and shield her students from the shooter himself. With the students in the closet, Victoria Soto was fatally shot by the gunman protecting her children. Miss Victoria Soto not only showed bravery and courage beyond what is called upon by a teacher but displayed warrior spirit that is rarely even seen within our military itself. Her selfless and heroic act saved the lives of 10 students in her class. It is with this knowledge, I am requesting that Miss Soto be granted the highest award granted to a civilian, the Medal of Freedom","2012-12-15 16:20:41",4951,19834,5166,25000,Closed

Cause of death, “Blunt force injury to head”, Manner of death, “Homicide”. Prosecutor Jeff Wible and Judge J. Scott VanDerbeck, made a mockery of Judicial System. Doctor J. Egli violates Medical ethics. He did not report the abuse in a timely fashion. All are friends with Shaffer’s father. Christy Shaffer was charged with Felony B neglect, she served 77 days.

Alissa’s brain showed lesions of trauma. It was determined that her hair had been ripped out. This case must be properly prosecuted.","2012-12-15 18:28:56",4956,27909,0,25000,Reviewed

Saying that they will praise God for executing his Judgement.  

These are innocent children.  These people picket funerals of our Nation's heroes, of the homosexual community, of anyone they deem fit.  This should not be protected by the first amendment because this is sick.  There is no other way to describe it.

There are currently 26 states that do not mandate counselors in all schools, grades K-12, and many others who have unrealistic student/counselor ratios which make it impossible for counselors to reach all students equally.  Let's do something now to help the mental health and well-being of our children by requiring all schools to have counselors available to all students, and by mandating a student/counselor ratio that makes effective counseling accessible to all students.","2012-12-15 20:20:37",4971,15087,9913,25000,Closed

1) The WBC does not engage in any charity comparable in scope to their public image. They are only known for hate.

2) The WBC is not inclusive of its surrounding community, restricting membership. It is regarded by some as a tax shelter for its family's law operations.
