    "In this poroject, I will experiment with the US petition data collected from [We The People website](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/28/we-the-people-five-years-of-online-petitions/). This data-set is unstructured and many petitions do not have petition IDs associated with them. Additionally the number of columns in many rows is not consistent with the majority of other rows. In the section below, I will use Pandas to read the file while coercing rows with different number of columns. After this process, we will have 1257 rows available. "

    "In this section, I iwll train a Doc2Vec model in order to embed every petition in a vector space. Doc2vec (aka paragraph2vec, aka sentence embeddings) modifies the word2vec algorithm to unsupervised learning of continuous representations for larger blocks of text, such as sentences, paragraphs or entire documents. Since the Doc2Vec class extends original Word2Vec class, many of the usage patterns are similar. One can easily adjust the dimension of the representation, the size of the sliding window, the number of workers, or almost any other parameter that you can change with the Word2Vec model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one exception to this rule are the parameters relating to the training method used by the model. In the word2vec architecture, the two algorithm names are “continuous bag of words” (cbow) and “skip-gram” (sg); in the doc2vec architecture, the corresponding algorithms are “distributed memory” (dm) and “distributed bag of words” (dbow). Since the distributed memory model performed noticeably better in the paper, that algorithm is the default when running Doc2Vec. You can still force the dbow model if you wish, by using the dm=0 flag in constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training the Doc2Vec model a number of pre-processing steps are requires. First, we will need to convert the encoding to utf-8. Then we will have to exclude punctuations and then, makes lists of separated words. We will then convert every word to lower case. After these steps, we will be able to train the Doc2Vec model. "

The last 10 years of war as well as disasters such as Hurricane Katrina have demonstrated to our country that the National Guard is an indispensable member of our national defense and disaster response forces. Like other military forces, the Guard has been challenged by long-term & multiple deployments to front lines in Iraq & Afghanistan, yet they are not currently represented in the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Becoming a permanent member of the JCS will further enhance the ability of the National Guard to perform both its state and federal missions by ensuring that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau is at the table when important homeland defense and disaster response issues are being addressed.\",\"The Fukushima nuclear disaster has forever destroyed the myth that nuclear power is clean or green: clean energy plants do not explode and release toxic radiation across the globe.

To handle the needs of today, the NFA branch workforce needs to be dramatically increased in size.  Additionally to reduce timelines and better comply with intentions of the paperwork reduction act, the NFA's antiquated paperwork process should be streamlined and computerized for further increased accuracy and efficacy to meet the NFA's needs for the future today.  The modernization of the National Firearms Act's paperwork process will increase government revenues by increasing taxpayer participation in this voluntary tax process, and will insure greater accuracy of record keeping going into the future. \",\"I am asking for Obama to demand Congress to Fund Research for Sarcoidosis, to make All forms of Sarcoidosis such as; Neurosarcoidosis,systematic and other forms of Sarcoidosis a Disability.\\r\\nI am a Neurosarcoidosis suffer/Advocate for the State of PA. \\r\\nI am also asking Obama to demand insurance companys to approve All treatments recomended for All forms of Sarcoidosis, not just the cheap ones. \\r\\nDespite what Congress thinks All forms of Sarcoidosis can and will kill even when treated. \\r\\nThere is no cure for Sarcoidosis, lets find a cure!\\r\\n\\r\\nThank You\\r\\nJessica Abouhamama\\r\\nOwner/Advocate- Faces Of Sarcoidosis\\r\\nwww.facesofsarcoidosis.org\\r\\nJessica@facesofsarcoidosis.org\",\"The US military fails to provide Equal Opportunity for non-religious service members. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are forced to participate in religious rituals during official ceremonies.

Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that sell product to treat these diseases may possibly own the rights to medicines, technology, and/or procedures to cure these diseases.  These companies might choose NOT to release this information to us, the patients, as it might adversely affect their sales of medication to treat our diseases.  If they own them, they may also choose to keep the cures OFF of the market.  It seems it is not illegal for these companies to do this.

Those slots should also cover US citizen and Permanent Resident International Medical Graduates (IMGs) . A recommended number is 21,000, based on a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That would not only help solve the physician shortage we now face in our nation and benefit the fast growing patient population, it would also pave the way for many US IMGs who have been denied a contributing role in this country to start doing what they were trained to do: saving lives. At the same time, these US IMGs would be able to care for their family and live their lives with dignity.

Once we trained this model on the entire corpus, we will be able to measure the extent of similarity between every petition and the main topics. In LDA, each document may be viewed as a mixture of various topics where each document is considered to have a set of topics that are assigned to it via LDA. Same pre-processing are required for this model as for Doc2Vec. In addition to those steps, we will also remove less useful words by useing a stop-word list. "
