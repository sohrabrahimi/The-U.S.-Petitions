    "# Train the Doc2Vec model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I iwll train a Doc2Vec model in order to embed every petition in a vector space. Doc2vec (aka paragraph2vec, aka sentence embeddings) modifies the word2vec algorithm to unsupervised learning of continuous representations for larger blocks of text, such as sentences, paragraphs or entire documents. Since the Doc2Vec class extends original Word2Vec class, many of the usage patterns are similar. One can easily adjust the dimension of the representation, the size of the sliding window, the number of workers, or almost any other parameter that you can change with the Word2Vec model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one exception to this rule are the parameters relating to the training method used by the model. In the word2vec architecture, the two algorithm names are “continuous bag of words” (cbow) and “skip-gram” (sg); in the doc2vec architecture, the corresponding algorithms are “distributed memory” (dm) and “distributed bag of words” (dbow). Since the distributed memory model performed noticeably better in the paper, that algorithm is the default when running Doc2Vec. You can still force the dbow model if you wish, by using the dm=0 flag in constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training the Doc2Vec model a number of pre-processing steps are requires. First, we will need to convert the encoding to utf-8. Then we will have to exclude punctuations and then, makes lists of separated words. We will then convert every word to lower case. After these steps, we will be able to train the Doc2Vec model. "

Such firearms are available over the counter with no additional restrictions in many Western countries with generally stricter gun control laws than ours.

Visa renewal is expensive and time consuming. The duration of validity should be extended to be commensurate with the intended academic program (typically 2 yr for master's and 5 yr for Ph.D.). An alternative approach is to allow renewal of F1 visa prior to the travel, so that in case the renewal is denied, the student would be given a chance to consider a later date of travel to avoid unexpected interruption of study and teaching. This would also prevent international students from risking their safety to renew their visas in neighboring countries, such as Mexico which is currently suffering from drug wars.\",\"Our country has seen tremendous growth in regards to the acceptance of minority groups, but research shows that LGBT youth continue to go through struggles both at school and home.

As such, the U.S. bears direct responsibility for any bloodshed in Ashraf and must do all that is necessary to stop another carnage. \\r\\n \",\"One out of every two adult Americans suffer from chronic illness. Many of such cases can be prevented or cured through transition to a plant-based diet.  Such a transition would reduce health care costs by up to $1.7 trillion.  A shift in policy to encourage vegan agriculture can also\\ufffdreduce 51% of greenhouse gas emissions. \\ufffdA switch to a vegan diet could reduce climate change mitigation costs by 80%.

Praxis, Teacher's board), have special abilities, and have skills and expertise in their field with years of experience under their belts. The steady improvement of education and testing results in several states are due to the infusion of foreign teachers who have turned the tables and drastically improved the annual results of the school districts. The granting and approval of permanent residency to foreign educators through a selective amnesty will greatly secure national interest.\",\"Dear President Obama,\\r\\n\\r\\nMy name is Sam Wessels.

It develops from the tissues that form the sympathetic nervous system (which controls body functions, such as heart rate & blood pressure, digestion and levels of certain hormones). It most commonly begins in the abdomen in the tissues of the adrenal gland, but it may also occur in other areas. It can spread to the lymph nodes, liver, bones & bone marrow.\\r\\n    Annually In the US, 650 children are diagnosed with Neuroblastoma\\r\\n    It is the most common tumor found in children younger than 1 year of age.\\r\\n Every 16 hrs a child with Neuroblastoma dies.\\r\\nOnly $150,000 government funding goes towards Neuroblastoma research\\r\\nFor more info www.julianasjourney.org\",\"Aaron Sandusky was wrongfully indicted and convicted by the federal government for operating a medical marijuana dispensary in CA in which it is fully legal within the state. \\r\\nAaron was operating in accordance to state guideline.

This process involves the underground injection of 1-8 million gallons of water per well, water that is laced with a mixture of 596 different chemicals. In 2005, Congress exempted oil and gas companies engaged in hydraulic fracturing from The Safe Drinking Water Act. With increased fracking, public drinking water is being poisoned by toxic chemicals with residents experiencing significant negative health effects and property damage. Proponents of fracking insist that the practice does not effect drinking water, and yet oil and gas companies still spend hundreds of millions lobbying against proposals to revoke the loophole created in 2005.

This limit only looks at half of the picture. We still have corrupt individuals in Congress who do not care about the interests of the American people. Despite this they somehow get voted in again and again, some incumbents being members of Congress for nearly their whole lives. Not only that but the members of Congress in it's current state are constantly planning for reelection. This causes them to put personal interests in order to get reelected ahead of doing what is right for the country. It is for all these reasons and more that we must have term limits. Not to mention 75% of Americans want them. \",\"\\\"Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates.\\\" Mark Twain.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational Talk Like a Pirate Day is celebrated September 19th around the world every year.

Several news organizations have documented large numbers of cancer-related illnesses connected with this same nuclear waste when it was first deposited near Lambert Airport in North St. Louis County, and It is now believed that the landfill fire could ignite this material, causing a major ecological disaster.

Live trapping, especially with footholds, typically causes no harm or suffering, and has allowed many species to be successfully reintroduced to native habitats where they were previously driven out. Trapping is carefully regulated by state game agencies, preventing over-harvest or physical damage to the animals. Without medicine, animals are prone to death by disease, as well as starvation or predation, especially as populations grow; those which do survive often move into human habitats and cause damage. Trapping prevents and corrects these situations by keeping populations if check. Therefore, trapping deserves to be recognized as the humane, necessary practice which it truly is.\",\"On August 1, 2010, nine days after giving birth Marissa Alexander was attacked by her ex-husband Rico Gray.

Over the years, colleges have reacted to budget short-falls by hiring part-time faculty. Today, over 70% of college faculty is part time. The IRS has recognized that adjunct hours of service are mostly untracked. Instead, most institutions compensate adjuncts only for credit hrs taught. As the IRS prepares to issue regulations, colleges have already reacted, imposing credit hour limits on each instructor. Some have cut as many as half the hours taught. If all remain, it spells financial disaster for many. The institutions, most with more full-time administrators than full-time faculty, are taking the easy way out.

This buffer zone was created in 1882 to prevent the sale of alcohol to the residents of the reservation until no longer necessary.  Roosevelt never proved this, deeming the order invalid.

People only interpret what they see rather than prove evolution through repeatable experimentation, which is the basis for science. To prove evolution there needs to be actual physical proof that life evolved from nonliving matter. This has never been done. The \\\"science\\\" used to prove the age of the earth is faulty and comes up with different ages for different things when the same piece of material is sent to different laboratories for testing. Evolution takes faith to believe in. Creation should be taught right beside evolution because it also requires faith. The fact that there are scientists that show data that points to creation means that both should be taught in our schools or neither should be taught.\",\"In the latest years in Russia, the state has promoted homophobia, denied equal rights to same-sex relationships, and now organizes an assault on everyday life of gays and lesbians.

Funds are the investment vehicle of choice for middle-class investors. Yet, current legislation requiring funds to annually distribute realized capital gains saddles fund investors with often-significant tax bills for simply holding a fund and reinvesting capital-gains distributions. This places funds at a disadvantage to other investments, particularly those available mainly to the wealthy. Meanwhile, current tax law provides highly preferential treatment for so-called \\\"carried interest,\\\" which allows hedge fund and private equity managers to reduce and defer taxes owed.

    "Doc2Vec showed some promise in finding petitions with similar content. We will now try Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to find the main topics in our corpus. Once we trained this model on the entire corpus, we will be able to measure the extent of similarity between every petition and the main topics. In LDA, each document may be viewed as a mixture of various topics where each document is considered to have a set of topics that are assigned to it via LDA. Same pre-processing are required for this model as for Doc2Vec. In addition to those steps, we will also remove less useful words by useing a stop-word list. "
